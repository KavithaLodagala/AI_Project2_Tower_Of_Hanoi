Project Title: SOLVING TOWER OF HANOI GAME USING A* SEARCH ALGORITHM AND RECURSIVE BEST FIRST ALGORITHM


Project is implemented in Python language

Required software: Visual studio IDE, python interpreter

Instructions for downloading the visual studio
download the software from the link: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/python/

Installation of visual studio:
1. Make sure your computer is ready for Visual Studio
2. Download Visual Studio
3. Install the Visual Studio installer
4. After the new workloads and components are installed, choose Launch. Then choose install
5. For Python, select the Python development workload and select Install
6. select the installation location
7. Start programming


****Execution steps*****

1. Project2_A05252367_ASTAR.py(A* search algorithm) and  
2. Project2_A05252367_RBFS.py (Recursive Best First Search algorithm) files.
2. To Solve tower of hanoi problem using A* we can run Project2_A05252367_ASTAR.py by clicking run button
3. Now the algorithm starts execution for all the disks which can complete within 30 mins (all 3 heuristic will complete execution for 11 disks in 30 mins)
4.  To Solve tower of hanoi problem using RBFS we can run Project2_A05252367_RFS.py by clicking run button
5. Now the time taken by both algorithms is calculated and memory consumed is also determined.
